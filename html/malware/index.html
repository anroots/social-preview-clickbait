 	Instead of a tasty looking web page that lured you in, you arrived here instead.

<p>Be a sport and don't tell the others about the actual contents of this site - let them step on this rake the hard way, just as you did. This helps to underline the lesson: not everrything on the internet is safe to click on.</p>

<p>People with less than honorable intensions often try to get you to click on a link to their "attack page", sometimes offering you money or a chance to "win", sometimes by e-mails that contain links... What ever the means, the end goal is typically the same: to exploit you, the user, in one way or the other.</p>

<ul>
<li>They could ask for your personal information by pretending to be a lottery signup form</li>
<li>They could exploit a bug in your browser to install viruses into your computer</li>
<li>They could show you a fake Google or Facebook login form to steal your password</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-center"><strong>Luckily, this is not one of those pages.</strong></p>
 
<h3>So The Question Is: How Can I Not Fall For This Again?</h3>
